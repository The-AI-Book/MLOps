    "### Improtant Metrics\n",
    "- Latency: delay between user's action and repsponse of application to user's action.\n",
    "- Throughput: Number of successful requests server per unit time say one second\n",
    "- Cost: the cost associated with each inference should be minimised\n",

    "- Cost increases as infraestructure is scaled\n",
    "- In applications where latency and throughput can suffer slightly\n"
