    "- Deals with detecting and dealing with problems in ML systems\n",
    "- Applies mainstream software engineering practices to ML models\n",

    "- Model debugging tries to improve the transparency of models by highlighting how data is flowing inside.\n",
    "- Model debugging also aims to reduce the vulnerability of your model to attacks.\n",
