    "\n",
    "## Why do models need to be monitored?\n",
    "---\n",
    "- Training data is a snapshot of the world at a point in time\n",
    "- Many types of data change over time, some quickly\n",
    "- ML Models do not get better with age\n",
    "- As model performance degrades, you want an early warning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data drift and shift\n",
    "---\n",
    "- Concept Drift: loss of prediction quality (the correct prediction has changed)\n",
    "- Concept Emergence: An emerging concept refers to new patterns in the data distribution that weren't previously present in your dataset. This can happen in several ways: labels may have become obsolete and new labels may need to be added.\n",
    "- Types of dataset shift: \n",
    "1. Covariate shift: The first is covariate shift. In covariate shift, the distribution of your input data changes, but the conditional probability of your output over the input remains the same. The distribution of your labels doesn't change. \n",
    "2. Prior probability shift: Prior probability shift is basically the opposite of covariate shift. The distribution of your labels changes, but your input data stays the same. Concept drift can be thought of as a type of prior probability shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Techniques\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical process control \n",
    "\n",
    "- Method used is drift detection method\n",
    "- Models number of error as binomial random variable\n",
    "$$ \\mu = n p_t, \\quad \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{n}} $$\n",
    "- Alert rule\n",
    "$$ p_t + \\sigma_t \\geq p_{\\min} + 3 \\sigma_{\\min}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential analysis\n",
    "- Method used is linear four rates\n",
    "- If data is stationary, contingency table should remain constant\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{gathered}\n",
    "P_{n p v}=\\frac{T N}{T N+F N} P_{\\text {precision }}=\\frac{T P}{T P+F P} P_{\\text {reall }}=\\frac{T P}{T P+F N} P_{\\text {pedatictu }}=\\frac{T N}{T N+F P} \\\\\n",
    "P_{*}^{t} \\leftarrow \\eta_{*} P_{*}^{t-1}+\\left(1-\\eta_{*}\\right) I_{y_{t}=\\hat{y}_{t}}\n",
    "\\end{gathered} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error distribution monitoring\n",
    "- Method used is Adaptive Windowing (ADWIN)\n",
    "- Calculate mean error rate at every window of data\n",
    "- Size of window adapts, becoming shorter when data is not stationary\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|\\mu_{0}-\\mu_{1}\\right|>\\Theta_{\\text {Hoeffding }} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Techniques\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering/novelty detection\n",
    "- Assign data to known cluster or detect emerging concept\n",
    "- Multiple algorithms available: OLINDDA, MINAS, ECSMiner, and GC3\n",
    "- Susceptible to curse of dimensionaly (you can use PCA)\n",
    "- Dos not detect population level changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature distribution monitoring\n",
    "- Monitors individual feature separetely at every window of data\n",
    "Algorithms to compare:\n",
    "- Pearson correlation in Change of Concept\n",
    "- Hellinger DIstance in HDDDM\n",
    "- Use PCA to reduce number of features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-dependent monitoring\n",
    "- Concentrate efforts near deicison margin in latent space\n",
    "- One algorithm is Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3)\n",
    "- Area in latent space where classifiers have low confidence matter more\n",
    "- Reduces false alarm effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Cloud AI Continuos Evaluation\n",
    "- Focus on concept drift\n",
    "- Leverages AI Platform Prediction and Data Labeling Services\n",
    "- Deploy your model to AI Platform Prediction with model version\n",
    "- Create evaluation job\n",
    "- Input and output are saved in BigQuery table\n",
    "- Run evaluation job on few of these samples\n",
    "- View the evaluation metrics in the console\n",
    "\n",
    "### How often should you retrain?\n",
    "- Depends on the rate of change\n",
    "- If possible, automate the management of detecting model drift and triggering model retraining\n"
